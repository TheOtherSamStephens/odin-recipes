        <p>My father and I created this easy 5-ingredient chili recipe and everyone we have made it for loved it. It is fast, simple, and delicious.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>15 ouncees tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans, not drained</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef  in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Stir in kidney beans, chili beans, and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil and stir in chili powder. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Editor's Note</h3>
        <p>Canned beans and tomato sauce contain varying amounts of salt, and the dish will taste more salty as it continues to simmer. Tasting and adding salt to the chili after it is finished will allow you to add just the right amount.</p>
